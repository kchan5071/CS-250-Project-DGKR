# VendBuddy
Students are Kai Chan, Diego Vasquez-Del-Mercado, Reese Norris, and Gabriel Jimenez

Overview: 
The software proposed is an application which allows college students to find the best deals for vending machines around campus. Students often have many hours between classes and most forget to pack food for their time at school. The app will allow students to locate vending machines, locate specific items, and review vending machines.
